                        <h2>Nintendo Wii and Wii U</h2>
                        <h3>The Nintendo Wii</h3>
                        <p>Compared to Microsoft and Sony's approach to consoles, Nintendo took a completely different approach with 
                            the wii, released in 2006. Instead of having powerful graphics like the competitors, Nintendo focused on motion controls
                            that encouraged players to move and interact with the games physically. That gained a more broader audience for thw Wii.
                            Games like Wii Sports and Mario Kart Wii became a staple for the Nintendo Wii, with the console selling over 100 million units. 
                            Early models were backwards compatible with GameCube games and accessories and later on, removed the backwards compatibility with later models 
                            and with the Nintendo Wii mini. <br><br>

                        <h3>The Nintendo Wii U</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Wii U, released in 2012, aimed to expand the idea from the original wii with its gamepad controller, which featured a touchscreen for second-screen
                            gameplay. Compared to the Wii, it was considered a commercial failure, with around 13 million units world wide. Due to it having a week lineup of games, limited 
                            third-party support and bad marketing. But it laid the groundwork for the Nintendo Switch. So the Wii U's focus on hybraod feacitres marked a transition toward modern games
                            later on.
